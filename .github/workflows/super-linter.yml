# This workflow executes several linters on changed files based on languages used in your code base whenever
# you push a code or open a pull request.
#
# You can adjust the behavior by modifying this file.

# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to run several linters on the code base whenever changes are pushed
# to the main branch or a pull request is opened against the main branch. It can also be triggered manually
# using the workflow_dispatch event.
#
# The workflow consists of a single job named "run-lint" which performs the following steps:
# 1. Harden Runner: Uses the step-security/harden-runner action to enhance the security of the runner environment.
# 2. Checkout code: Uses the actions/checkout action to fetch the code from the repository with full git history.
# 3. Lint Code Base: Uses the super-linter/super-linter action to run various linters on the code base.
#
# The workflow requires the following permissions:
# - contents: write (for the workflow itself)
# - contents: read (for actions/checkout to fetch code)
# - statuses: write (for super-linter to mark the status of each linter run)
#
# Environment variables:
# - DEFAULT_BRANCH: Specifies the default branch (main) for the repository.
# - GITHUB_TOKEN: Provides a token to authenticate with GitHub.
# - DISABLE_ERRORS: Disables errors in the linter output (set to true).
#
# For more information on configuring and using the Super Linter, visit:
